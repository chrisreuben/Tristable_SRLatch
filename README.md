# Tristable_SRLatch
Tristable SR Latch Using CMOS Logic (Optimized)
This repository showcases an optimized Tristable SR Latch designed using CMOS logic, developed and tested using the Cadence tool. The SR (Set-Reset) latch is a fundamental building block in sequential circuits, and this tristable version introduces an additional stable state, allowing for greater control and versatility in digital designs.

Key features of the project:

Designed using CMOS logic for low power consumption and high noise immunity
Simulated and optimized using Cadence tools for enhanced performance
Tristable functionality with stable Set, Reset, and Hold states
Ideal for memory storage elements and sequential logic applications
This project focuses on optimizing the latch for minimal propagation delay, power efficiency, and robustness in modern digital systems.
